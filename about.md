Hey there! I'm Marianna, and I'm all about diving into the awesome world where economics, tech, politics, and public policy meet. Academia has been quite the adventure, and sharing knowledge is genuinely one of my favorite things. Beyond research, I've also got some hobbies that light up my day. I'm a bookworm, love playing with paint when I've got some downtime, and find joy in taking care of my little urban garden.

## 🌐 About This Blog

This blog is my little corner of the internet where I want to share my research and teaching materials, dip my toes into the world of blogging (let's give it a shot!), and connect with fellow researchers and lifelong learners. 🌟
